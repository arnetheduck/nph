# VSCode nph integration

Format [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) code using [`nph`](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph).

Full-featured `Nim` support including formatting via `nph` is available from the [official Nim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NimLang.nimlang) - if you're using it, `vscode-nph` is no longer needed.

## Features

Enables formatting of Nim code via `Format document` from the command palette as well as format-on-save if enabled in settings.

## Requirements

You need to have `nph` installed and available in your `$PATH`.

Binaries are available for download from the [release page](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph/releases).

**Enjoy!**
